# Post-Brexit-Fishing-vessel-project
Publicly available code for my project with Fran√ßois-Charles Wolff on studying  the effects of a French 2023 post-Brexit aid package on French fish markets using a protected dataset containing the universe of fish sales in France.

This read-me file summarizes the origin of the data used for the beggining of this research project, the role of the different R files and the meaning of the various outputs. Unfortunately, some of the data used is protected data from Pr. Wolff, and I am not able to share it here, although I make available the code running on it and some of the related output.

This first step of the research process consists in constructing counterfactual fish sale values for fishing vessels that were removed from circulation during 2024.
