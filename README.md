# Post-Brexit-Fishing-vessel-project
Publicly available code for my project with Fran√ßois-Charles Wolff on studying  the effects of a French 2023 post-Brexit aid package on French fish markets using a protected dataset containing the universe of fish sales in France.

This read-me file summarizes the origin of the data used for the beggining of this research project, the role of the different R files and the meaning of the various outputs. Unfortunately, some of the data used is protected data from Pr. Wolff, and I am not able to share it here, although I make available the code running on it and some of the related output.
